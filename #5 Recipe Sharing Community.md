# #5 Recipe Sharing Community

### 1\. Project Overview

The **Recipe Sharing Community** is a full-stack web application aimed at bringing together cooking enthusiasts, providing a platform where users can share, discover, and organize recipes. Targeting home cooks, culinary students, and anyone passionate about cooking, the platform allows users to post favorite recipes, contribute interactive ingredient checklists, and share cooking time estimates. The community fosters sharing culinary knowledge, supporting social engagement.

Key features include user registration, recipe submission with detailed ingredient lists, a built-in cooking timer, and social features such as commenting, rating, following users, and upvoting/downvoting posts. Premium features, such as exclusive content access, will be available through a subscription-based model.

    *   **Ingredient Checklist (optional)**: Users can interact with the checklist to track gathered ingredients.
         - Each ingredient in a recipe will be listed on the screen.
         - Users can check or uncheck the ingredients they've gathered by interacting with the list (e.g., by clicking checkboxes).
         - Once an ingredient is checked, it visually indicates that it's ready, helping users focus on the remaining ingredients.
         - Consider allowing users to also add custom ingredients or remove ones they don’t need.
         - You can enhance this by showing the number of remaining ingredients, or even group them based on type (e.g., spices, vegetables).

         - Users can start a timer for specific cooking durations (e.g., “Boil for 5 minutes”).
         - The timer counts down and gives a notification (like a sound or popup) when time is up.
         - You can let users set custom durations for each step or even multiple timers for different steps of the recipe running simultaneously.
         - Optionally, allow the timer to pause or reset if needed.
