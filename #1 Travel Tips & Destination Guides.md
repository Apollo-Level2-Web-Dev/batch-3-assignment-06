# #1 Travel Tips & Destination Guides

### Project Overview:

The **"Travel Tips & Destination Guides"** platform is designed to build an engaging community of travel enthusiasts, enabling users to share their personal travel stories, exchange valuable tips, and interact with fellow travellers. The platform provides user authentication and registration, allowing users to personalize their profiles, follow others, and contribute their own travel content. Additionally, it offers premium content access via payment integration for exclusive features. By combining informative travel content with social interactions, this project aims to empower users to make informed travel decisions, discover new destinations, and create memorable travel experiences.

#### 6\. **Payment Integration**:

*   Integration with payment gateways like Aamarpay or Stripe, allowing users to make payments for premium content access (such as exclusive travel guides, destination tips, or verified user privileges).

#### 7\. **News Feed**:

*   A dynamic news feed that displays the latest travel posts from the community.
*   Infinite scrolling to load more content as the user scrolls down the page.
*   Filtering and searching options by post category or user, with sorting based on upvote count to surface the most helpful content.

#### 8\. **Following System**:

*   Users can follow other travellers.
